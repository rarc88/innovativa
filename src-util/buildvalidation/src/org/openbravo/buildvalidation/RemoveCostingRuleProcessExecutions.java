/**
 * This build validation prevents issue #29127 by deleting rows in ad_process_run for executions of
 * CostingRuleProcess which is removed but due to issue #29142 update database process is not able
 * to properly handle.
 * 
 * It is a temporary workaround and it should be removed one #29142 is resolved.
 * 
 * It should have been implemented as ModuleScript because it is repairing data, but because
 * ad_process_run and ad_process_request tables are recreated when updating from PR14Q3 to PR14Q4,
 * module script would be executed without indexes nor DB statistics which might result, depending
 * on the data volumes in these table, in slow executions due to poor query execution plans.
 * Exceptionally, implementing it as build validation to be executed before actual database update
 * allowing better plans.
